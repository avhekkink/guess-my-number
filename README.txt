My first JavaScript project created with 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann

** GUESS MY NUMBER GAME **

Start the game by opening the html file in a web browser!

Tools and technologies used:
- Started from boilerplate code for the html document and css styling

- Implemented game logic using JavaScript and practiced DOM manipulation

- Refactored code to follow DRY principle and improve readability
