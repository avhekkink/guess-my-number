My first JavaScript project created with 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann

** GUESS MY NUMBER GAME **

Simple game where the player aims to guess the mystery number between 1-20 and is given higher/lower clues to help get there.

Start the game by cloning the repo and running live-server to open the index.html file in browser

Tools and technologies used:
- Started from boilerplate code for the html document and css styling

- Implemented game logic using JavaScript and practiced DOM manipulation

- Refactored code to follow DRY principle and improve readability
